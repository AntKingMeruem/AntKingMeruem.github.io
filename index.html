        <h1>Welcome to my Page!</h1>
        <p>I know; it's pretty underwhelming right now, but this will be a website dedicated to my csc class I am currently taking.
            As you can see, it's still pretty empty, but the plan is to continuously update it and by the end of the class, I'll have
            some cool stuff on here. This is just the homepage, so most if not all of the projects will be located in the javascripts tab.</p>
