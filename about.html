        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>    My name is Allen Ly; I am currently pursuing the Electrical Engineering degree offered by the College of Engineering,
                and a Spanish degree offered by the College of Arts and Sciences. I also have a mathematics minor. I'm currently 
                entering my senior year, so I hope to be done soon, and hope to enter the industry after finishing my studies. 
                Ideally, I will work somewhere in power systems design, though I do have to take an exam to get a license if I 
                wanted to enter that field of work, so I'm not quite sure about it just yet. On my free time, I try to do things that
                I like provided I don't have to do any adulting. I draw sometimes, and I also am watching this cartoon series called
                "One Piece". Above, I provided an image of the cartoon and one of my drawings. This website was created in order
                to satisfy a requirement for one of my classes. Although it's not a part of my major, I thought it was a good 
                opportunity to take a class and expand my knowledge. </p1>
